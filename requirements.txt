# MyShell - Secure Python Shell Implementation
# This project uses only Python standard library modules

# No external dependencies required!
# All functionality is built using Python's standard library:
# - os, sys, subprocess, shlex, re, pathlib, string

# Optional: readline for command history (Unix/Linux only)
# readline is built into Python on Unix/Linux systems
# On Windows, it's not available but the shell works without it

# If you want readline support on Windows, you can install:
# pyreadline3>=3.4.0

# Python version requirement:
# Requires Python 3.11 or higher
